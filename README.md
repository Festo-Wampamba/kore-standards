## 📖 Project Overview

**JobLinkUG** is a capstone project developed by final-year Business Computing students at **Makerere University Business School**. The platform addresses the fragmentation in Uganda's labor market by centralizing employment opportunities and leveraging Artificial Intelligence to connect job seekers with legitimate employers.

Unlike traditional job boards, JobLinkUG utilizes **AI Vector Embeddings and Semantic Search** to understand the context of candidate skills and job requirements. This allows for higher-quality matches beyond simple keyword searching, reducing recruitment bias and improving hiring efficiency for both the formal and informal sectors.

* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive interface optimized for low-bandwidth environments (average 5-15 Mbps) in urban and semi-urban Uganda.
